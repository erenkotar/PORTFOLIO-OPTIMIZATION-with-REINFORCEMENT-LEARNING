-Official Implementation-

**About Source Code**:
The thesis is implemented mainly via [FinRL module](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL), which includes modules like StableBaselines3, YahooFinance, etc. which are very useful for the project. Module brings other modular functionalities that allow various preprocessing, feature engineering, and testing methods which constitute the project's backbone. The implementation is explained in detail in the "5. APPLICATION" part of the thesis which can be downloaded free via Research Gate link above.

The idea in the Thesis is implemented with small changes made in the beautiful [GitHub repo](https://github.com/changjulian17/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/Investment_Portfolio).
